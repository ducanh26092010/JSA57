      It's urgent, but we don't have time in the next two years to test it, but
      we must prioritize it. At least we don't need to obfuscate it. You must
      rethink the whole process. We will give you a slice of pizza if you finish
      the code until yesterday. Make it pop remember, the entirety is equal or
      better. We must build a queue system to ensure it gets the data from our
      API so this will result in a delay. How does this indicator should look?
      Also please answer to question from the next mail. Kind reminder. Please
      inform us where we are on this. After the release, we will need to test it
      individually. This was the last time when you are allowed to promote
      something urgent in the production when you was asked for.
